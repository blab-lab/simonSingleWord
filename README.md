## To run the experiments
Experiments are run in MATLAB. You also need the code in the free-speech repository (https://github.com/carrien/free-speech). You may also need the [blab-lab fork of Audapter](https://github.com/blab-lab/audapter_mex) and [Audapter functions](https://github.com/blab-lab/audapter_matlab). Setup instructions are in the repo's README file.

You will need to update the file path assigned to helpersDir in L32 of `run_simonSingleWord_audapter` and L45 of `run_simonSingleWord_v2_audapter`. You will also need to update the file path assigned to expt.dataPath in L24 of `run_simonSingleWord_expt` and L31 of `run_simonSingleWord_v2_expt`.

## To run the data analysis scripts
R and RStudio are needed. Data (including statistical models) can be found at: https://osf.io/d4t6s/.
